# 🧍‍♂️ Human Movement Monitoring System (Django + SQLite)

A **Full-Stack Motion Tracking and Alert System** developed as part of a **project under IIT Roorkee (Feb 2023 – Nov 2023)**.  
This system detects and tracks human body movements in real time, triggers alerts when predefined spatial limits are exceeded, and stores movement data efficiently for analysis.  

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🧠 **Real-Time Motion Detection:** Implemented a Django-based backend system that monitors body movements and triggers alerts when motion exceeds preset coordinates.  
- 📊 **Enhanced Oversight Efficiency:** Achieved **40% improvement in monitoring efficiency** through automated tracking and alert mechanisms.  
- 🧩 **Full-Stack Implementation:** Built a **responsive, user-friendly frontend** with modern UI components integrated with **RESTful APIs**.  
- 🔄 **Optimized Communication:** Designed seamless frontend-backend integration, reducing development and debugging time by **30%**.  
- 💾 **Lightweight Data Handling:** Utilized **SQLite** for structured storage of movement data and user activity logs.
